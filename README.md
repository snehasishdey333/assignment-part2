This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

In this assignment I was given a JSON data, I had to use it and make a useful representation of the data in form of a Hospitality Experience Portfolio.

I created 4 main components to show the UI to the user.
these are Experience Card, Experience List, Fliter Bar, Project Card.

the whole page consists of some experience lists, which consists of experience cards and these consists of project cards. 

The filter bar is to filter experiences according to year and type. 
I have taken care of null functionality also , that is the main reason I have used TypeScript in this project.

I have deployed the page using Vercel.

Deployed URL: https://assignment-part1-sblt.vercel.app/

Please feel free to give me feedback about my project. If there is any areas where I can improve, I will definitely appreciate and improve it.

This was the part 2 of the assignment.
Looking forward to a positive response. ❤️
